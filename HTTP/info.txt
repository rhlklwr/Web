A URI is a string of characters that identifies a particular resource to uniquely identify and locate it around the Web.
An URL is the most common type of URI. It specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation of a resource describing this resource located on a particular server.

The URL is formed by three parts: scheme, host and path.
Scheme: it’s a protocol to use to access the resource.
Host: it’s the server location
Path: Path to the resource inside the server.
