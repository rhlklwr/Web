Redux - 

1. Single Source of Truth
2. State is read only
3. Changes using pure functions

Action => Root reducer => Store (it contains all state) => DOM changes

Flux Pattern (instead of MVC pattern)

Action => Dispatcher => Store => View

import { provider } from 'react-redux'

action object

import { connect } from 'react-redux'
