Redux - 

1. Single Source of Truth
2. State is read only (state never get modified)
3. Changes are made only using pure functions

Action => Root reducer (it is an pure function) => Store (it contains all state) => DOM changes

Flux Pattern (instead of MVC pattern)

Action => Dispatcher => Store => View => Action

import { provider } from 'react-redux'


action object
We always return new object so our component can be re-render

redux flow - 
Action => Middleware => Root Reducer => Store => Dom changes

npm install redux redux-logger react-redux


import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
add <Provider> in main <App> so every one can access store object
eg:- <Provider>
            <App>
        <Provider>

import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import logger from 'redux-logger';



import { connect } from 'react-redux'
