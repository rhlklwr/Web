Redux - 

1. Single Source of Truth
2. State is read only (state never get modified)
3. Changes are made only using pure functions

Action => Root reducer (it is an pure function) => Store (it contains all state) => DOM changes

Flux Pattern (instead of MVC pattern)

Action => Dispatcher => Store => View => Action

import { provider } from 'react-redux'


action object
We always return new object so our component can be re-render


import { connect } from 'react-redux'
