React Router - 

import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Switch>
        <Route exact path='/' component={HomePage} />
        <Route path='/hats' component={HatsPage} />
</Switch>

import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

<BrowserRouter>
    <App />
</BrowserRouter>,

withRouter
You can get access to the history object’s properties and the closest <Route>'s match via the withRouter higher-order component. withRouter will pass updated match, location, and history props to the wrapped component whenever it renders.

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
<Link className='option' to='/shop'>


In the previous lesson, you may have seen the strange syntax: import { ReactComponent as Logo }

This is a new special syntax when importing SVG in React. The ReactComponent import name is special and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename. You can read more about it here, but keep in mind that this is a React library special syntax:

this.setState({ [name]: value})
In Javascript, when you create an object literal {} and you wrap the object’s key in array brackets [key] you can dynamically set that key.
So in our example when I created the disneyCharacter object, I dynamically set the object’s key in the disneyCharacter object to Mickey Mouse.
